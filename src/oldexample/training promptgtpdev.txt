the training should be taking on input file for example "input_117.h5" and then matching it with the chosen stem via the indetifier number, in this example 117,
".\cache\target_vocals_117.h5"
".\cache\target_other_117.h5"
".\cache\target_noise_117.h5"
".\cache\target_keys_117.h5"
".\cache\target_guitar_117.h5"
".\cache\target_drums_117.h5"
".\cache\target_bass_117.h5"
".\cache\input_117.h5"
here are examples of filenames
for a single stem training, the input is the test
if the single stem we are training would be for example "vocals" we then use ".\cache\target_vocals_117.h5" to test against ".\cache\input_117.h5"
with the other stems ".\cache\target_other_117.h5"
".\cache\target_noise_117.h5"
".\cache\target_keys_117.h5"
".\cache\target_guitar_117.h5"
".\cache\target_drums_117.h5"
".\cache\target_bass_117.h5" being used as the learning how to differentiate and use the model to create the wanted vocal, so it can stem seperate,
if the data isn't put in right or shuffled, testing will be messed up, so do it the way I describe
